#  Agent Rules - React + Vite
# Zero-Error Development Workflow

# INTRODUCTION
# This ruleset implements a bulletproof development workflow for React + Vite projects.
# Every error triggers our chain of thought process to ensure zero tolerance for bugs.
# We prioritize prevention over fixing, defensive coding over assumptions.
# When you encounter ANY error, follow the workflow chain religiously.

# CORE ERROR WORKFLOW
error_chain:
  1. STOP - Take a breath
  2. IDENTIFY - What's the actual error?
  3. PROPOSE - Suggest a solution
  4. FIX - Implement the fix
  5. VERIFY - Does it work?
  6. REFLECT - Will this prevent future errors?

# REACT + VITE STANDARDS
structure:
  components: "PascalCase.tsx"
  hooks: "useCamelCase.ts" 
  utils: "camelCase.ts"
  types: "TypeName.ts"

code_rules:
  - Always use TypeScript strict mode
  - Add proper error boundaries
  - Validate props with interfaces
  - Handle async errors with try-catch
  - Use optional chaining (?.) everywhere
  - No console.log in production

# ERROR PREVENTION
defensive_code:
  - Validate all inputs
  - Handle loading/error states
  - Use proper dependency arrays
  - Add null checks
  - Implement proper cleanup
